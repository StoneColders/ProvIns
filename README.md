# ProvIns
# We Provide Insurance  
This was our VIT Hack project under the Servify Track  
3 tasks were presented to us:  

1. Device Detection using mobile camera by Tensorflow lite model  
We have incorporated the model given to us with Core ML of swift to create a feature which instantly detects the device in front and adds it to the collection of devices.  

2. Detecting Devices on a Particular Network  
We have created a feature similar to Fing which lists out the IP address and MAC address of all the devices on a particular network.  

3. Creating an algorithm to uniquely identify each device  
We have combined a devices MAC address alongwith a randomly generated value in backend to create a unique ID.
